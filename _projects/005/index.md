title: Istana Wakil Presiden, Sarana & Prasarana IKN
description:  Ibu Kota Nusantara (IKN), Indonesia’s new capital city, is being developed as a smart, sustainable, and climate-resilient city that prioritizes energy efficiency and environmental responsibility. As part of this vision, the Vice Presidential Palace complex within IKN adopts a hybrid cooling system to meet its diverse cooling needs while minimizing energy consumption and carbon emissions. This system combines mechanical and passive cooling methods, allowing it to adapt to varying thermal loads across different building zones, and is supported by a centralized Water Cooled Chiller System and intelligent control units for optimal performance. By integrating advanced technology with climate-responsive design, the hybrid cooling approach supports IKN’s broader goals of creating high-performance infrastructure that is both energy-conscious and environmentally sustainable.
